Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources; however, its efficiency is highly dependent on solar panel orientation and surface cleanliness. Fixed photovoltaic (PV) systems suffer from reduced energy output due to the continuous movement of the sun and the accumulation of dust and environmental pollutants on the panel surface.
This graduation project, titled Solar Mind, presents the design and implementation of an intelligent dual-axis solar tracking system integrated with a smart self-cleaning mechanism. The system utilizes light sensors to continuously align the solar panel with the optimal sun position in both horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, voltage and current sensors are used to monitor the generated power and detect performance degradation.
Unlike traditional time-based cleaning methods, the proposed system activates the cleaning process only when a significant drop in output power is detected, ensuring efficient water and energy usage. The system is controlled using an Arduino Mega microcontroller and incorporates safety mechanisms such as limit switches and controlled motor operation.
The Solar Mind system aims to enhance overall energy efficiency, reduce maintenance requirements, and provide a reliable and autonomous solution suitable for modern solar energy applications.
